# MyReads Project

This is the project 7 from Udacity FEND. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library.

## App Functionality Overview

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.

The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.
